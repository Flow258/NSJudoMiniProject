Notes for competition Clas
The Competition class is supposed to be a competition instance and implements Serializable
interface for the object serialization. This contains a static final field serialVersionUID,
used to make sure the serialized object can be re deserialized. The field numCom type byte
represents the competition number, and has its own class variable. In addition there is a
field trainingPlan, a String that is the training plan associated with the competition.
Also defined by the class are the following methods:

1. A static final field COMPETITION_FEE of 22.00f with the meaning of the fee to participate in a competition.
The constructor of the Competition class takes two parameters: It initializes numCom and trainingPlan
and the respective fields. In the calculateFee() method the total fee for the competition is computed
from the training plan. The method returns the product of numCom and COMPETITION_FEE if trainingPlan
is either "Intermediate" or "Elite". If the training plan does not satisfy these criteria then the method
returns 0.0f or no fee from other training plans.
