Notes for TrainingPlan Class
TrainingPlan is an abstract class that was designed to represent different kinds of the training plans.
It contains a static final field serialVersionUID for the purpose of Serialization. Further, it always
has a final protected field known as WEEKLY_FEE_MULTIPLIER which has an initial value of 4 and it is
utilized to determine fees. The class defines two abstract methods: getPlanName(), which you have to
override and getPlanName() in order to calculate the fees related to the payments of the athlete.

Notes for BeginnerPlan Class
The BeginnerPlan class is derived from the TrainingPlan class and provides a training plan for beginners.
They contain a static final fie ld serialVersionUID for serialization consideration and a static final fee
fie ld FEE which is assigned with the value of 25.00 for this particular plan. The getPlanName() method in
the controller’s class returns the string “Beginner”, and it also suggested to explore the option where switch
statement can be incorporated. this.calculateFee() – the method calculate the total fee by multiplying the FEE
by the WEEKLY_FEE_MULTIPLIER or some portion of it.

This section discusses some notes for IntermediatePlan Class.
Another class is the IntermediatePlan class which also inherits from the TrainingPlan is meant for intermediate
level athletes. Like all the other classes it has static final field for serialization: serialVersionUID and the
static final field FEE which equals 30.00. The getPlanName() method gives a string value “IntermediatePlan” and
the calculateFee() method calculates the fee as FEE multiplied by WEEKLY_FEE_MULTIPLIER.

Notes for ElitePlan Class
Another subclass of TrainingPlan is the ElitePlan class where the training plan is made for elite athletes.
There is an internal final field, which is needed for serialization: it is static final double serialVersionUID.
